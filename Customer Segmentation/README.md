This folder contains both the code and documentation for a customer segmentation project that utilizes unsupervised learning techniques. The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer data and classify customers into separate groups based on their spending habits, characteristics, and gender.

You can see the distinct behavior difference between males and females in each cluster in the histogram.
In the project file, you can find additional analyses and insights.
